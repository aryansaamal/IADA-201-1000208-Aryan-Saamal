# **MindPatch – AI-Assisted Digital Detox & Wellness Planner 🌿**

MindPatch is a **user-centred, AI-assisted digital wellness application prototype** designed to help students and young adults manage screen time, reduce digital fatigue, and maintain emotional balance.
The app focuses on **mindful technology use, emotional awareness, and positive habit formation** through gentle nudges rather than strict restrictions.

This project was developed as part of the **Critical and Creative Thinking – Summative Assessment** under the **Artificial Intelligence course**.

---

## 📌 **Project Purpose**

In today’s highly connected digital environment, students often experience:

* Excessive screen time
* Mental fatigue and anxiety
* Burnout due to constant digital engagement

MindPatch addresses these challenges by combining:

* Mood awareness
* Screen-time reflection
* AI-based detox planning
* Habit tracking with rewards

The core goal is to **support balance, not enforce control**.

---

## 🔍 **Main Research Findings**

Secondary research indicates that excessive screen time is strongly linked to increased stress, anxiety, and reduced emotional well-being among students. Studies emphasize that **self-awareness, gentle nudging, and habit-based interventions** are more effective than restrictive digital controls.

Research insights from existing wellness and productivity applications such as **Headspace** and **Forest** informed the design decisions. Their use of calm interfaces, motivation techniques, and non-judgmental behavior nudges influenced the emotional design, AI logic simulation, and overall user experience of MindPatch.

## 🧠 **Key Features**

### 1️⃣ Mood Check-In

Users begin their journey by logging how they feel using an emoji-based mood scale (1–5).
This prioritizes emotional awareness and sets the foundation for personalized suggestions.

---

### 2️⃣ Screen-Time Dashboard

* Users manually input daily screen time
* Weekly visual summaries promote reflection
* Optional permission-based screen-time access is **conceptual and simulated**, ensuring ethical and privacy-safe design

---

### 3️⃣ AI Detox Planner

The AI Detox Planner provides wellness suggestions based on:

* Mood score
* Screen time
* Time of day
* Habit completion status

**Example suggestions include:**

* Short tech breaks
* Breathing and mindfulness exercises
* Screen-free activities
* Light motivational content

⚠️ No real AI model is implemented.
The AI logic is **rule-based and simulated** using decision flows.

---

### 4️⃣ Gratitude Journal

A calm journaling space where users write daily positives, helping build mindfulness, gratitude, and emotional grounding.

---

### 5️⃣ Habit Tracker & Rewards

Users track habits such as:

* Mindfulness or breathing exercises
* Reduced screen time before sleep
* Consistent wellness routines

Progress is displayed visually using streaks and completion indicators.
Rewards reinforce positive behavior through **motivation, not pressure**.

---

### 6️⃣ Profile & Preferences

Users can:

* View personal details
* Update goals and preferences
* Reset goals
* Manage data & privacy

This ensures transparency, ethical design, and user autonomy.

---

## 🎨 **Design Approach**

* Soft pastel color palette (lavender, light blue, white)
* Rounded UI components
* Minimal text and low cognitive load
* Emotionally supportive visuals
* Accessibility-focused spacing and typography

The design prioritizes **calmness, clarity, and emotional safety**.

---

## 🤖 **AI Logic Simulation**

The AI behavior is **rule-based and simulated**, not predictive or data-harvesting.

### Example Logic:

```
IF mood < 3 AND screen time > 4 hours
→ Suggest a detox break

IF habit streak is consistent
→ Encourage continuation with motivation

IF late-night usage detected
→ Suggest screen-free activity or sleep reminder
```

Over time, the system adapts conceptually to:

* Mood trends
* Time-of-day usage
* Habit consistency

This demonstrates **ethical AI thinking without implementing live AI models**.

---

## 🧪 **Testing & Iteration**

The prototype was tested with peer users.

### Feedback Highlights:

* Interface feels calm and non-judgmental
* Mood logging is intuitive
* Detox suggestions feel supportive, not controlling

### Iterations Made:

* Simplified AI planner text
* Improved button visibility
* Reduced information overload
